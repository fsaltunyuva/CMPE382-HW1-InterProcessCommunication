# CMPE 382 Operating Systems

## Homework 1 - Multiprocess concept: fork () and pipe() system calls

In this homework, you are expected to write a C program, which demonstrates interprocess communication IPC between three processes using pipes. Your program as the parent process should create two child 
processes and utilize four pipes, establishing a multi-directional communication as shown in the figure below.

Note that unnecessary pipe ends must be closed to prevent improper pipe usage. Each pipe needs one write one read end to remain open for two way communication.

The parent process should read a filename as a command line argument (so that different files can be used on each execution). Each file should have an unspecified number of random integers. The parent process P1 should read integers and send to BOTH child processes one by one.

* P2 receives the integers one by one, categorizes each integer according to number of digits. For 
readability, implement a function named “int nrDigits(int)” to do this. You may assume integer 
numbers in the test files be between 0 and 99999. Count the number of integers received according 
to the number of digits.

* P3 receives the integers one by one, computes the number of prime integers received. Implement a
function named “int isPrime(int)” to do this.

When P2 and P3 have finished their jobs, they must submit back the results they have computed back 
to the parent process and terminate.

Parent process P1, after receiving results from P2 and P3 should print a nicely formatted output as 
given in the following example and should terminate.

### Sample Outputs
```
$ ./homework1 numbers.txt
Input file: numbers.txt

1 digits - 0
2 digits - 4
3 digits - 21 
4 digits - 283 
5 digits - 692 
Primes - 108 
Nonprimes - 892
```

```
 $ ./homework1 numbers2.txt
 Input file: numbers2.txt

 1 digits - 6
 2 digits - 62
 3 digits - 529 
 4 digits - 4875
 5 digits - 13026 
 Primes - 1986
 Nonprimes – 16514
```


### Remarks

* You may (modify and) use the following shell script to generate input files with random numbers:

    ```
    for i in {1..1000}; do echo $((RANDOM)) >> numbers.txt; done
    ```
* Both child processes receive unknown number of (say N) integers from the pipe in stage one (one 
integer per read operation), but write only once during stage two (all results in one write operation).
